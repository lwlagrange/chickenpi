#Chicken Pi

This program controls the temperature of a chicken coop by taking readings
from temperature sensors and activating a cooling fan and heat lamp to reach
desired temperature. It also takes readings from a ambient light intensity
sensor and opens the door to coop at sunrise and closes at night
