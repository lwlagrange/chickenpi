#Chicken Pi

ChickenPi is a raspberry pi program designed to control the temperature of a chicken coop by taking readings from DS18B20 temperature sensors and activating a cooling fan or heat lamp to reachdesired temperature. It also takes readings from a BH1750 light intensity sensor and opens the coop door at sunrise.
